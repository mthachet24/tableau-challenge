Analysis: 

1. Bike Stations Start and End Locations 2019-2020

Based on looking at the map for the start and end locations for the bike stations, one common factor between all four maps is that majority of the bikers started and ended practically in the same area. The area around Grove St. Path seemed to be the common area that had a lot of the start and end bike station locations. There were other stations in different parts of the city but the area around Grove St. Path was the most common among bikers. This was the case for both 2019 and 2020.

2. Gender Statistical Analysis from 2019-2020


There were some interesting gender statistics regarding the citi bike data. For the average trip duration, females had a higher peak in both 2019 and 2020 than the males did. However, the male gender represented the most out of all genders in both 2019 and 2020. The gender that was labeled as "unknown" wasn't represented as much in 2019 than they were in 2020.
