Analysis: 

1. Bike Stations Start and End Locations 2019-2020

Based on looking at the map for the start and end locations for the bike stations, one common factor between all four maps is that majority of the bikers started and ended practically in the same area. The area around Grove St. Path seemed to be the common area that had a lot of the start and end bike station locations. There were other stations in different parts of the city but the area around Grove St. Path was the most common among bikers. This was the case for both 2019 and 2020.
